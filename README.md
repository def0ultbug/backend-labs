# Backend Labs 🔬

A collection of my hands-on experiments and mini-projects with Python for learning backend development concepts, frameworks, and architectural patterns.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository documents my journey learning:
- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework for building APIs
- **Backend Architecture** - System design & Architectures, scalability, and best practices
- **Design Patterns** - Reusable solutions to common software problems

Each folder represents a focused learning exercise with its own README and implementation.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- [ ] Master FastAPI fundamentals and advanced features
- [ ] Understand different architectural patterns (monolith, microservices, serverless)
- [ ] Implement common design patterns in real-world scenarios
- [ ] Practice writing clean, maintainable backend code
- [ ] Explore database design and optimization
- [ ] Learn authentication, authorization, and security best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
- `README.md` - Concept explanation and learning objectives
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies
- Source code with comments explaining key concepts
- Tests (where applicable)


### Running a Project
```bash
# Navigate to a specific project
cd fastapi/01-hello-world

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
